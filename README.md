Project Overview:

This project focuses on analyzing the stock performance and revenue trends of **Tesla (TSLA)** and **GameStop (GME)**. By utilizing the **yfinance** library, we extract real-time stock data, including key metrics like price. Additionally, we employ the **BeautifulSoup** library to scrape and analyze data from HTML pages, specifically focusing on revenue details from the provided web links. Using the requests library, we download essential web pages containing historical revenue and stock information. This integrated approach not only provides a comprehensive view of the financial health of these companies but also equips investors and analysts with valuable insights for informed decision-making. Whether you're a seasoned investor or a beginner, this project serves as a resource for understanding the dynamics of the stock market and the impact of company performance on stock valuations.
